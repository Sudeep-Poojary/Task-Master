># **`What is JavaScript?`**

JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.

Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.

># **`What is NodeJS?`**

Node.js is a cross-platform runtime environment and library for running JavaScript applications outside the browser. It is used for creating server-side and networking web applications. It is open source and free to use.

Many of the basic modules of Node.js are written in JavaScript. Node.js is mostly used to run real-time server applications.

By definition, Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules to simplify the development of web applications.

`Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library`

># **`What is ExpressJS?`**

Express is a fast, assertive, essential and moderate web framework of Node.js. You can assume express as a layer built on the top of the Node.js that helps manage a server and routes. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

># **`What is Embedded JavaScript?`**

EJS or Embedded Javascript Templating is a templating engine used by Node.js. Template engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into HTML template at the client side and produce the final HTML. EJS is a simple templating language which is used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It also helps to embed JavaScript to HTML pages.

># **`What is MongoDB?`**

MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. In simple words, you can say that - Mongo DB is a document-oriented database. It is an open source product, developed and supported by a company named 10gen. MongoDB is available under General Public license for free, and it is also available under Commercial license from the manufacturer.

The manufacturing company 10gen has defined MongoDB as:

"MongoDB is a scalable, open source, high performance, document-oriented database." - 10gen

MongoDB was designed to work with commodity servers. Now it is used by the company of all sizes, across all industry.

># **`What is Mongoose?`**

Mongoose is a third-party package that builds upon the official MongoDB driver, but it makes accessing MongoDB much easier and more convenient. Mongoose use schemas that mongodb does not really use, so we can define how our data should look like and that allows us to conveniently store and fetch data.
